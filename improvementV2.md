Let's break down the best ways to improve the ORACLE's conversational memory and address your concerns about cost and context window limitations.

**You are absolutely correct that simply including the last few turns has limitations:**

* **Context Window Limits:**  Large language models have a finite context window. Including too much conversation history can push out the relevant document context, hindering the ORACLE's ability to answer accurately.
* **Cost:**  Longer prompts mean more tokens, which translates to higher API costs.
* **Relevance Decay:**  Not all past interactions are equally relevant to the current question. Including irrelevant history can dilute the prompt and confuse the model.

**Here's a breakdown of the best strategies, building upon your existing foundation and incorporating Langchain:**

**1. Refining Your Current Approach (Simple but Effective):**

* **Configurable History Length:** Your suggestion to make the number of past turns configurable (`conversation_history_turns` in `RAGConfig`) is a great first step. This allows you to experiment and find the sweet spot for your specific use case.
* **Prioritizing Recent Turns:**  Focusing on the most recent interactions is generally a good heuristic, as they are often the most contextually relevant.
* **Clear Prompt Instructions:**  Explicitly instruct the model in the prompt to consider the previous conversation. Your updated `generate_answer` function does this well.

**2. Leveraging Langchain's Memory Modules (More Sophisticated and Flexible):**

Langchain provides powerful memory modules specifically designed for managing conversational history. These modules offer more advanced features than simply storing a list of turns. Here are some key options:

* **`ConversationBufferMemory`:** This is the simplest form of memory. It stores the entire conversation history in a buffer. While easy to use, it can quickly exceed context window limits for longer conversations.

* **`ConversationBufferWindowMemory`:** This memory type keeps a *rolling window* of the conversation. You specify the number of interactions (k) to keep in memory. This is a good balance between retaining context and managing token usage. **This is likely the best starting point for your ORACLE.**

* **`ConversationSummaryMemory`:** This module summarizes the conversation over time. Instead of storing every turn, it creates a concise summary of the key topics discussed. This is excellent for very long conversations where you need to maintain high-level context without exceeding token limits.

* **`ConversationSummaryBufferMemory`:** This is a hybrid approach. It keeps a buffer of recent interactions but also maintains a summary of earlier parts of the conversation.

* **`ConversationTokenBufferMemory`:** Similar to `ConversationBufferMemory`, but it limits the memory based on the number of tokens rather than the number of interactions. This is useful for staying within API token limits.

* **`ConversationKGMemory` (Knowledge Graph Memory):** This more advanced memory type extracts entities and relationships from the conversation and stores them in a knowledge graph. This allows the model to reason about the conversation in a more structured way.

**How to Integrate Langchain Memory:**

Here's how you would typically integrate a Langchain memory module (using `ConversationBufferWindowMemory` as an example) into your `RAGSystem` class:

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory

class RAGSystem:
    def __init__(self, config: Optional[RAGConfig] = None):
        # ... your existing initialization code ...
        self.memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=self.config.conversation_history_turns)

    def query(self, question: str) -> Optional[str]:
        try:
            # ... your existing code to retrieve relevant chunks ...

            # Load the conversation history from memory
            history = self.memory.load_memory_variables({})['history']

            # Build the prompt, including the history
            prompt = f"""You are a helpful assistant. Consider the following conversation history and the provided context to answer the question. If the answer cannot be derived from the context or previous conversation, say so.

            Conversation History:
            {history}

            Context:
            {' '.join(relevant_chunks)}

            Question: {question}

            Answer:"""

            response = openai.chat.completions.create(
                model=self.config.completion_model,
                messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
            )
            answer = response.choices[0].message.content

            # Save the current interaction to memory
            self.memory.save_context({"input": question}, {"output": answer})

            return answer

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error during query: {e}")
            return None

    # You would likely remove or refactor your `generate_answer` method
    # as the memory management is now handled by Langchain.
```

**Key Changes:**

* **Import `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`:**  Import the necessary memory module from Langchain.
* **Initialize Memory in `__init__`:** Create an instance of the chosen memory module, passing in any necessary configuration (like `k` for the window size).
* **Load History in `query`:** Use `self.memory.load_memory_variables({})['history']` to retrieve the conversation history.
* **Include History in Prompt:**  Incorporate the `history` into your prompt.
* **Save Context in `query`:**  Crucially, use `self.memory.save_context({"input": question}, {"output": answer})` to add the current question and answer to the memory.

**3. Summarization of Conversation History:**

For very long conversations, summarizing the history can be a powerful technique to stay within context window limits.

* **Langchain's `load_summarization_chain`:** Langchain provides chains specifically for summarizing text. You could use this to periodically summarize the conversation history and include the summary in the prompt instead of the full history.
* **Pros:** Significantly reduces token usage for long conversations.
* **Cons:**  May lose some detail and nuance from the earlier parts of the conversation.

**4. Context Compression:**

This is a more advanced technique where you try to identify the most relevant parts of the conversation history to include in the prompt.

* **Langchain's Context Compression:** Langchain offers components for context compression, allowing you to filter and select the most important information to pass to the language model.
* **Pros:** Can be very effective at reducing token usage while retaining relevant context.
* **Cons:** More complex to implement.

**Addressing Your Concerns:**

* **Limiting Conversation History:** Langchain's `ConversationBufferWindowMemory` and summarization techniques directly address this by either keeping a limited window or condensing the history.
* **Cost:**  Using `ConversationBufferWindowMemory` with a reasonable window size or employing summarization are effective ways to manage API costs.
* **Making it More "Chatbot-like":**  By consistently including relevant conversation history in the prompt, the ORACLE will be able to understand the context of the current question better and provide more coherent and contextually appropriate answers, making it feel more like a natural conversation.

**Which Approach is Best for You?**

* **Start with Langchain's `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`:** This is a good balance of effectiveness, ease of implementation, and cost-efficiency. Configure the `k` parameter (number of turns to remember) in your `RAGConfig`.
* **Consider `ConversationSummaryMemory` for very long conversations:** If you anticipate users having lengthy interactions with the ORACLE, this can help manage token usage.
* **Explore Context Compression for advanced optimization:** If you need to squeeze the most out of your context window and are comfortable with more complex implementations, look into Langchain's context compression features.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Langchain is your friend:** It provides powerful tools for managing conversation history.
* **`ConversationBufferWindowMemory` is a great starting point.**
* **Summarization is useful for long conversations.**
* **Context compression offers advanced optimization.**
* **Experiment with different approaches and configurations to find what works best for your specific use case and budget.**

By implementing these strategies, you can significantly improve the conversational abilities of your Intelligent Document Oracle, making it a more engaging and helpful assistant. Remember to experiment and iterate to find the optimal configuration for your needs!
